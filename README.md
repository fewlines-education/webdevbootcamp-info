But for now, let's open with some guides and information to help you through the journey!

## Day organisation

### Morning course

The morning course will **start at 9am**. If you want to take a â˜•, better be there a few minute before!

If you are not in the office, connect to the online class room few minutes before 9am if possible. 

### During the day

Except for the lunch time, teachers will be there.

After the morning courses you will have a lot of work to do! Sometimes there will be several exercises, to help you understand and practice with concepts.
You will also have projects to create. Some will take you one or two days, some other will be scheduled on a complete week.

Learning could be hard as you'll maybe see. It's important for you to take breaks. Let your brain cool ðŸ¥¶!

At the end of the day, at ðŸ• **5.30pm**ðŸ•  we will wrap the day together.
